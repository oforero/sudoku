Sudoku
======

Introduction
------------

Just for fun, I am attempting to write a sudoko solver program in different languages.
I did the first implementation in Haskell because it keeps me honest by making difficult to take questionable shortcuts.

The current implementation uses a combination of Depth First Search with a repeated applications of single elimination rules (naked single). 
It solves all the sudokus from project Euler and a the list of hard sudokus from Peter Norvig.

For the specifics on each implementation follow the link:

* [Clojure] (clojure/README.md)
